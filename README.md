# Georgia Image Packs

These packs will all need to be extracted to a folder called `images` which you will need to create in your foobar profile folder. On a non-portable installation this will typically be `C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Roaming\foobar2000`.

* **Record Labels**: Extract to `.../AppData/Roaming/foobar2000/images/`
* **Artist Logos**: Extract to `.../AppData/Roaming/foobar2000/images/`
* **Flags**: Extract to `.../AppData/Roaming/foobar2000/images/`
