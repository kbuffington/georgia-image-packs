# Georgia Image Packs

These packs will all need to be extracted to a folder called `images` which you will need to create in your foobar profile folder. On a non-portable installation this will typically be `C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Roaming\foobar2000`.

* **Record Labels**: Extract to `.../AppData/Roaming/foobar2000/images/`
* **Artist Logos**: Extract to `.../AppData/Roaming/foobar2000/images/`
* **Flags**: Extract to `.../AppData/Roaming/foobar2000/images/`

When everything is properly installed your image folder should be setup like [this](https://i.imgur.com/40YdD4l.png). (Ignore Band Logos color as it isn't used by this theme, or included here.)


## Updates

While the flags images are unlikely to be updated, both artist and record labels will be updated frequently. As these archives are rather large, you shouldn't need to download them all again when 95% of the images are unchanged. This "Monthly Image Packs" folder contains downloads of just the files updated since the last time you downloaded the images. Just grab the archives you need. If you can't remember the last time you grabbed the images, there is a file in each folder titled something like `!Last Downloaded-2018-09-02`. Grab everything after that date and you should be good. If that file doesn't exist you have the original release from 2018-06-29.


#### fanart.tv

Almost all of these artist and record label logos files can be downloaded from [fanart.tv](https://fanart.tv). They require standard settings for the image types, and every image is reviewed. My label packs will include every white record label image, and most white artist logos if the artist/band seems popular enough to include.

I made a decision to not include color logos because of the potential for visual clashing with the auto-generated themes. If you would like to use color logos for artists, they can be stored in a folder called `/images/artistlogos color/`.
