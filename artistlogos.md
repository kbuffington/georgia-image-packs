# Where did artistlogos.zip go?

The current Artistlogo.zip archive has continued to grow in size and currently encompasses over 2500 images, and is over 107MB zipped up (and heavily compressed beforehand). Github has a limit of 100MB for file sizes which means it can't be stored normally here. In earlier releases I had split the archive into multiple parts (.zip, .z00, etc.), but this was confusing and prone to user error. Going forward the artistlogo.zip can be downloaded from [this link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4fwoeo7zlrxcj31/artistlogos.zip?dl=1). The updated "monthly" packs will still be stored on github.
